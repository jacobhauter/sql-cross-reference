# Cross Referencing Financial Records Using SQL

## PROBLEM:
- Needed to compare an extract of customer names with multiple other extracts, including core system, wealth management database, and brokerage database

## SOLUTION:
- Utilized SQL to combine multiple extracts
- Used client full name as primary key

#### ATTACHED FILES:
- SQL script  

#### DISCLAIMER: 
- All data is faux and not representative of myself, employers, clients, or associates.  
- Though the templates and data layout is representative of what I worked with, the populated data itself is completely redacted/fabricated.
